# RetroRocket Retro & Vintage Toys

## About the Project

RetroRocket is a two-sided marketplace for reconnecting with your inner child. Find your childhood toys of the past, or list your own treasures for sale to go to a loving new home.

This marketplace specialises in retro and vintage toys from the 90s and earlier. Listings on the site are categorised according to the nature of the toy, so you can find exactly what you're looking for. 

## Scope

RetroRocket is designed for Australian users, and targeted at users aged 20-50 years old. The website design aims to be easy to use on both mobile and desktop devices to allow for ease of access across all age groups.
